        <p>
          When the USSR was intensively exploring and developing the riches of the Arctic back in the 1930s, sending
          polar explorers on scientific missions to drifting ice, the Institute of Public Catering Engineers worked out
          a special diet for members of polar expeditions. People were supposed to live and work in inhuman conditions,
          at extremely low temperatures, and therefore they relied on healthy, super-calorie and — most importantly —
          light and compact foods. In addition to chocolate, butter, cheese, etc., ice conquerors consumed such a
          delicacy as pressed caviar. Few residents of the USSR ever tasted it, but polar explorers were entitled to it
          — and for a very good reason
        </p>

        <p>
          The Russian word for pressed caviar — ‘payusnaya’ — comes from the word for the pouch in which fish nurtures
          the roe. The fundamental differences between pressed caviar and fresh-grain caviar include the method of
          preparation, density, and appearance. Preset pressed caviar is a branded product; therefore, thorough quality
          control is exercised at each production phase. Fresh caviar is first kept in a warm salt solution (usually
          referred to as ‘tuzluk’ brine), and then, when it is sufficiently salted, it is dehydrated, as excess liquid
          is removed in steam-convection units at a temperature of 62 °C, so that shrinkage loss reaches 35%. Then
          caviar is aged and fermented for nine days in sterile refrigeration units at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to
          2 °C. As a result, 100 grams of Preset pressed caviar contains 130 to 140 grams of natural fresh-grain caviar,
          while the flavor of the delicacy also becomes concentrated and therefore more vivid than that of wild, natural
          caviar.
        </p>

        <p>
          All dietary properties are fully preserved. Thanks to dehydration, Preset pressed caviar can be stored much
          longer — and does not require preservatives. Fermentation, a mandatory production stage for Preset, lends the
          product excellent digestibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          a. Although black caviar has evolved as a traditional symbol of the aristocratic menu and the global demand
          for it has been growing, many distributors and manufacturers still provide limited supplies. This product
          belongs to the top price category — and for a reason. Sturgeons are not chicken; breeding them is a long,
          expensive, and unpredictable process. In order to slash costs, some producers of pressed caviar are ready to
          make it from crumpled, damaged, and sometimes not exactly fresh caviar, which is almost past its expiry date.
          But, of course, you cannot have first-class pressed caviar from second-rate primary product. Therefore, only
          fresh top-quality caviar with an intact egg shell is used to make Preset.
        </p>

        <p>
          b. Flavor advantages compared with “raw” caviar Pressed caviar has a more intense flavor, with an extended
          aftertaste showing a delicate nutty note that lasts up to five minutes. There are no foreign flavors, because
          we always know what and how our sturgeons eat and closely monitor their diet. Our pressed caviar does not
          smell of silt, mud, or fish. There is no way a manufacturer can guarantee that wild sturgeons have had a happy
          trouble-free life in a pristine river or lake. The sturgeon is a bottom-dwelling fish, and it is on the
          bottom, in the silt, that we find all the harmful substances and elements of human pollution.
        </p>

        <p>c. Composition advantages compared with “raw” caviar</p>

        <p>
          Since sturgeon caviar is currently produced as part of aquaculture using artificial feed, fat content in such
          caviar is reduced by about 15%–20% compared with wild fish caviar. But pressed caviar, a concentrated product
          with the same fat and protein content in a smaller volume, ensures a higher density of valuable substances in
          the product. This mostly applies to fat, because it is in fat that Omega 3, 5, and 6 acids— which are
          essential substances for humans — can be found. Pressed caviar is on par with “natural” caviar in this
          respect. And some fans like our pressed caviar even more than its “wild” counterpart!
        </p>

        <p>d. Application and storage advantages compared with “raw” caviar</p>

        <p>
          Pressed caviar can be stored much longer than “raw” caviar (see expiration date on the package), without
          losing its flavor. Furthermore, its stability is guaranteed: whenever you open a jar of Preset pressed caviar,
          you can be sure that the product has been made in compliance with all standards, you will not be
          heartbreakingly disappointed, because the caviar suddenly smells of sludge, or tastes funny altogether.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides, pressed caviar can and should be consumed without any special ceremonies and preparations: it is
          quite dense — almost like cheese — and therefore neither crumbles nor gets dirty, it can be easily applied as
          a topping to bread or any other foundation. Due to the exceptional caloric content of pressed caviar and its
          incredible nutrient content, even a small canapé will both please and support your body.

      <h2>Content of useful substances in Preset pressed caviar (per 100 g)</h2>
      <img class="text-page__side-image" src="../../img/caviar-2.png" alt="Caviar with Spoon" />
      <div class="text-page__text">
        <h3>Protein</h3>
        <p>
          There are 30 grams of protein in 100 grams of pressed caviar. Protein requirement in humans is calculated
          according to the simple formula — 0.5 gram per kilo of weight. A couple of teaspoons of Preset (you will
          hardly notice them!) will be enough to meet almost a third of your daily protein needs! And thanks to
          fermentation, caviar protein even helps insulin production, making it easier to control blood sugar levels. It
          is hard to overestimate the role of protein in the human body, which is why it is so important to consume
          high-protein products — and we proudly recommend Preset caviar as one of the best options.
        </p>

        <h3>Omega-3 fatty acids</h3>
        <p>
          There are approximately 11 grams of omega-3 fatty acids in 100 grams of pressed black caviar. A single
          tablespoon (about 1.5 grams of omega-3) is a standard daily dose for an adult! Notably these valuable fatty
          acids can only be consumed from external sources, for example, from our daily meals. The main function of
          omega-3 is to improve immunity and balance metabolism.
        </p>

        <h3>Vitamins</h3>
        <p>
          Pressed caviar contains a whole package of vitamins: A, D, E, C, and B group. Vitamins support vital
          activities. Scientists currently refer to vitamin D as “the most important vitamin”. Vitamin D content in
          caviar is 8 micrograms per 100 grams of product, which constitutes almost 100% of the daily standard!
        </p>

        <p>
          Vitamin D helps maintain healthy bones and teeth, boosts immunity, encourages brain function, and may even
          have an impact on preventing serious diseases such as cancer. Vitamin D also helps absorb other important
          minerals like calcium and phosphorus.
        </p>

        <h3>Minerals</h3>
        <p>
          Pressed caviar contains large amounts of minerals. Calcium content is estimated at around 275 micrograms per
          100 grams of caviar. A couple of tablespoons a day will help maintain optimum calcium levels — and this
          ensures healthy and robust bones, regulates blood pressure, and strengthens the nervous system.
        </p>

        <h3>For emotions</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the sheer pleasure of eating genuine, legendary black caviar; in addition to enjoying its
          flavor, its light, faint fragrance, and its wonderful creamy, nutty aftertaste, pressed caviar really helps
          with depression and irritability, as it promotes dopamine production. Dopamine secretion in the human body
          serves as a motivator: this hormone makes you do things that bring you closer to achieving what you need, even
          if it takes a lot of effort.

      <h2>Composition</h2>
      <div class="text-page__text">
        <p>
          Pressed caviar composition on the label looks very simple: 242 kcal, 30 g protein, 17 g fat, 0.8 g
          carbohydrates, 0.2 g vitamins per 100 g. But not everything is indicated on the label.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pressed caviar, just as regular black caviar, includes almost all micronutrients that the human body requires.
          The nutrient composition of pressed caviar is so extensive and rich that if a human body lacks some element,
          it would be absolutely safe to say: eat some pressed caviar. This advice is never wrong!

        <h3>In cooking</h3>
        <p>
          Some insist that black caviar needs nothing but a thin piece of bread with an invisible slice of butter. A
          hard-boiled egg is a great alternative. Others strongly disagree and will happily add it to every dish — from
          bouillabaisse to ratatouille. Our firm belief is that freedom of will is given to man to enjoy pressed caviar
          as they wish, without imposing their culinary views on their neighbor. It is enough to share caviar with their
          neighbor.

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Even during the manufacturing stage, when moisture is evaporated due to extended heat exposure, Preset pressed
          caviar achieves maximum microbiological safety and therefore reliably ensures a long shelf life without the
          use of preservatives. Our product contains exclusively caviar and salt. Not caviar, salt, and a page-long list
          of thickeners, coloring substances, stabilizers, flavorings, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shelf life before opening the jar is one year. Once opened, the product should be stored within the
          temperature range from 0 °C to +4 °C and consumed within one week.
        </p>
